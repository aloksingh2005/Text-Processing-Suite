## Project Overview

The Text Processing Suite is a comprehensive web application that offers a variety of text analysis and manipulation tools. It allows users to:

- View real-time statistics about their text (word count, character count, etc.)
- Convert text between different cases
- Clean text by removing extra spaces or duplicate lines
- Reverse text in various ways
- Sort text lines alphabetically
- Copy, download, or clear text content

The application features a responsive design with light/dark theme support and persists user preferences and content using localStorage.
